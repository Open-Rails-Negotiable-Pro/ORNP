Using the installer scripts.txt
Last updated: 2014-05-02 by Chris Jakeman

1. Download and install Inno Setup from http://www.jrsoftware.org/isdl.php
Initial trials (Apr 2014) used v5.5.4. Open Rails v1.4 uses 6.1.2

2. Download Microsoft .NET Framework 4.7.2 web installer for Windows from
    https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/microsoft-net-framework-4-7-2-web-installer-for-windows-dda5cddc-b85e-545d-8d4a-d213349b7775
   and save in
  <A>\.NET Framework 4.7.2 web installer\ndp472-kb4054531-web.exe
  where <A> is any folder.
  
2. Make a chain of folders inside folder <A>: <A>\Temp\Installer\
   From Source\Installer, copy OpenRails.iss and Version.iss into <A>\Temp\Installer

3. If you wish to update the version name from "1.4", then edit the line
     #define MyAppVersion "1.4"
	 in the file 
   <A>\Temp\Installer\Version.iss
  
4. Repeat the following as often as required:
  A. Download OR zip file from http://openrails.org/files/OpenRails-Testing.zip

  B. Unzip into folder 
    <A>\Open Rails\Program\

  C. Remove 
    <A>\Open Rails\Program\Updater.ini 
  as James Ross advises because the updater cannot update an installed version yet.

  D. Download source from http://openrails.org/files/OpenRails-Testing-Source.zip and extract 
  folder Documentation.

  E. Copy contents into folder
    <A>\Open Rails\Program\Documentation\

  F. Use Inno Setup > Project > Compile to compile the installer script
    <A>\Temp\Installer\Installer.iss
  
  G. The installer file will be found in <A>\Temp\Installer\Output\OpenRailsSetup.exe
 
5. Test the installer by building Virtual Machines with a fresh copy of Windows.
Open Rails v1.4 is compatible with Windows from 7 (SP1) to 10 (1809) and, hopefully, beyond.

Arrange for the VM to have Internet access and a shared folder.
Copy OpenRailsSetup.exe to the shared folder.
Copy a VM with a fresh copy of Windows to make a sacrificial trial platform.
VirtualBox has Remove and Clone options on the right mouse button.
VMWare finds a copy made using File Explorer and asks if that was a Copy or Move operation.
From inside the VM, copy the OpenRailsSetup.exe file from the shared folder to a new folder C:\_tmp\
That avoids a ShellExecuteEx error code 3 "The system cannot find the path specified."
